										<h2>
											Project 1
										</h2>
									</header>
									<p>In the first project, we were asked to consider the question: "If ... on campus was smart?"</p>
									<h4>Empathizing</h4>
									<p>
										Firstly, I went out to meet with people who currently stay on campus. I was able to informally interview 
										two of my peers. The main problem that was raised was being able to find a place to sit on campus and in the library.
										They also raised a point about the library usually being full at certain times, and wasting time going to the library and not
										finding a seat.
									</p>
									<h4>Ideation</h4>
									<p>
										Initially, I considered a smart bench concept in order to provide better more efficient seating areas, but I thought this idea may be 
										too expensive. So I took inspiration from car garages that list the occupancy of the garage outside the building. I thought if we could 
										find a way to measure the number of people exiting the library we can use the existing gates as datapoints. This is the idea that I pitched
										to the group.
									</p>
									<p>
										After additional brainstorming, we had the idea to connect the counter to both displays outside the library as well as to the popular
										student application USThing. Aside from the cost of the display, this is a cheap option because USThing is already an existing application 
										used widely across the student body. This means we can reach people faster and without the cost of hosting. This would require a partnership and
										negotiation with the USThing team but I am positive they would be on board.
									</p>
									<h4>Design</h4>
									<p>
										After our brainstorming session, I designed the application UI. My methodology in designing the UI was to a) stick to established Material UI principles,
										such as using cards to store information as well as a standardized header and footer,
										and b) stick as closely as possible to the existing design of the USThing app, influencing the color scheme and layout. 
										By sticking to standards I am able to adhere to gestalt theory as well as best practices. By sticking to the existing design, I maintain familiarity for the user leading to
										a more intuitive and usable app. It also includes additional features such as calculating the current capacity based on an estimated number of total seats in the library, as well
										as boooking available rooms at a glance through USThing.
										Below is the final result:
									</p>
									<div class="box alt">
										<div class="row gtr-50 gtr-uniform">
											<div class="col-4"><span class="image fit"><img src="images/hciproj1ui.png" alt="" /></span></div>
										</div>
									</div>
									
									<p>
										For the exit gates, we decided to go with the cheapest option of installing break beam sensors that detect when a person walks by the gates. We Initially
										considered using artifical intelligence and computer vision to perform the counting, but ultimimately decided against it because break beams are a lower cost, lower tech alternative that 
										uses the existing infrastructure more effectively.
										The below concept video created by my teammate illustrates the concept:

									<p>
										I think that this project was especially useful in learning to identify with users needs and issues. I was able to gather a lot of information
										from just a few questions about user pain points and effectively turn it into a workable idea. I hope that someone with a driven mindset picks
										up on the idea and makes it into a reality. To further expand upon the idea, we should also consider the same installation on the LG1 floor
										since it is an additional point of entry to the library.
