									<p>In the first project, we were asked to consider the question: "If ... on campus was smart?"</p>
									<h4>Empathizing</h4>
									<p>
										Firstly, I went out to meet with people who currently stay on campus. I was able to informally interview 
										two of my peers. The main problem that was raised was being able to find a place to sit on campus and in the library.
										They also raised a point about the library usually being full at certain times, and wasting time going to the library and not
										finding a seat. Furthermore, after interviewing the library staff we realized that the current method of counting students in the library
										uses an analog counter. This is clearly outdated and can be improved upon. See the counter below:
									</p>
									<div class="box alt">
										<div class="row gtr-50 gtr-uniform">
											<div class="col-4"><span class="image fit"><img src="images/counter.jpeg" alt="" /></span></div>
										</div>
									</div>
									<h4>Ideation</h4>
									<p>
										Initially, I considered a smart bench concept in order to provide better more efficient seating areas, but I thought this idea may be 
										too expensive. So I took inspiration from car garages that list the occupancy of the garage outside the building. I thought if we could 
										find a way to measure the number of people exiting the library we can use the existing gates as datapoints. This is the idea that I pitched
										to the group.
									</p>
									<p>
										After additional brainstorming, we had the idea to connect the counter to both displays outside the library as well as to the popular
										student application USThing. Aside from the cost of the display, this is a cheap option because USThing is already an existing application 
										used widely across the student body. This means we can reach people faster and without the cost of hosting. This would require a partnership and
										negotiation with the USThing team but I am positive they would be on board.
									</p>
									<h4>Design</h4>
									<p>
										After our brainstorming session, I designed the application UI. My methodology in designing the UI was to a) stick to established Material UI principles,
										such as using cards to store information as well as a standardized header and footer,
										and b) stick as closely as possible to the existing design of the USThing app, influencing the color scheme and layout. 
										By sticking to standards I am able to adhere to gestalt theory as well as best practices. By sticking to the existing design, I maintain familiarity for the user leading to
										a more intuitive and usable app. It also includes additional features such as calculating the current capacity based on an estimated number of total seats in the library, as well
										as boooking available rooms at a glance through USThing.
										Below is the final result:

										<div class="row gtr-50 gtr-uniform">
											<div class="col-4"><span class="image fit"><img src="images/hciproj1ui.png" alt="" /></span></div>
										</div>
									</div>
									
									<p>
										For the exit gates, we decided to go with the cheapest option of installing break beam sensors that detect when a person walks by the gates. We Initially
										considered using artifical intelligence and computer vision to perform the counting, but ultimimately decided against it because break beams are a lower cost, lower tech alternative that 
										uses the existing infrastructure more effectively.
										The below concept video created by my teammate illustrates the concept:
									</p>

									<h2>Reflection</h2>
									<p>
										I think that this project was especially useful in learning to identify with users needs and issues. I was able to gather a lot of information
										from just a few questions about user pain points and effectively turn it into a workable idea. I hope that someone with a driven mindset picks
										up on the idea and makes it into a reality. To further expand upon the idea, we should also consider the same installation on the LG1 floor
										since it is an additional point of entry to the library.
									</p>
									<p>
										If I was to do anything differently, I would spend more time formally interviewing students and doing more brainstorming. Because we were low on time,
										we spent less time Empathizing and Ideating than I normally prefer so that we could create the designs and prototypes before the deadline. I think this
										means that our group will do pretty well when it comes to the next assignment because we are more of the creative type. We seem to like making things more 
										than doing research. I will make sure to play into that strength for the next project, while also realizing that we need to be more organized and on task.
									</p>
									<p>
										In conclusion, this project has been a lot of fun. After watching the other presentations, I feel confident that our idea is cheap, sustainable and easy to 
										implement. Although we have a simpler idea than a lot of the other groups, we took the time to focus on details and making sure that what we had was practical 
										and realistic. Looking forward to the next project!

									<p>In the second project, we implemented a working prototype / proof-of-concept quarantine chat bot.</p>
									<h4>Needfinding</h4>
									<p>
										In order to identify the needs of users in quarantine we had a brainstorming session. Both me and Linnea have been in quarantine before, 
										so we gave our thoughts on what we thought would be useful. We decided that a practical and pragmatic chat bot may be the right choice, with
										features such as being able to order food, get more information about tests and checking out as well as mental health resources available without 
										pretending to be experts in the field.
									</p>
									<div class="box alt">
										<div class="row gtr-50 gtr-uniform">
											<div class="col-12"><span class="image fit"><img src="images/mindmapproj2.png" alt="" /></span></div>
										</div>
									</div>
									<h4>Implementation</h4>
									<p>
										I suggested in our meeting session that we should take a divide and conquer approach to implementing this prototype by taking advantages of GitHubs 
										branching features. I assigned myself to implement the food delivery system. I started by setting up the github repository and forking the tutorial 
										repo. I then had a meeting with Linnea to make sure that we understood the Rasa concepts and could create a working prototype. I figured that the best 
										way to approach the implementation was using modified test-driven development: I used usability testing in order to drive the development forward instead 
										of only as an evaluation tool. 
									</p>
									<h5>version 1.0</h5>
									<p>
										My first working ordering system was very bare bones. Firstly, there was no way for me to validate the slots of the dish and the drink. Secondly, 
										the bot would stop running after a storyline was finished, which meant repeated use required refreshing the page. 
									</p>
									<h5>version 1.1</h5>
									<p>
										In version 1.1 I found a solution to both of the problems of v1.0. For the slot validation I implemented a validation function that was a custom action, 
										and would run after the form was finished and had filled all slots. If the user missed a step, the bot would apologise and try to tell the user to restart. 
										For the storyline restart, I added the action “action_restart” after some of my stories that would reset the bots storyline which solved that issue.
									</p>
									<h5>Usability Testing (v1.1)</h5>
									<p>
										For usability testing I asked two of my friends who have been in quarantine also to go on video-call. I shared my screen and asked them to try to order food. 
										They told me what to input to the bot word for word and gave feedback on what they found confusing and would like to see improved. Here is a video showing the 
										key moments of this test session:
									</p>
									<iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/t36Kr6EsoXg" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen></iframe>
									<p>
										I summarised their feedback into a shared Google Sheets, and for each pain-point I suggested a change. I ended up solving 3/4 of the problems that the users had in testing.
									</p>
									<div class="box alt">
										<div class="row gtr-50 gtr-uniform">
											<div class="col-12"><span class="image fit"><img src="images/usability_test_table.png" alt="" /></span></div>
										</div>
									</div>
									<h5>version 1.2</h5>
									<p>
										For v1.2 I solved the validation problem by replacing my custom action with a dedicated FormValidation class and slot validation functions 
										for both drinks and food. I added static methods to make it very easy to change the menu items without needing to rewrite other pieces of code. 
										I also made it possible to skip ordering a drink and added additional training data where the model was lacking in detecting hungry intent. 
										I also modified the front-end slightly to better suit the needs of our prototype.
									</p>
									<div class="box alt">
										<div class="row gtr-50 gtr-uniform">
											<div class="col-4"><span class="image fit"><img src="images/burger1.png" alt="" /></span></div>
											<div class="col-4"><span class="image fit"><img src="images/burger2.png" alt="" /></span></div>
										</div>
									</div>
									<h5>version 1.3: final</h5>
									<p>
										I was responsible for merging the three branches together, which occasionally led to some conflicts. I ended up rewriting some code, but the 
										functionality remained the same. The final version as well as a complete commit history of the project can be found in the link below:
									</p>
									<ul class="actions">
										<li><a href="https://github.com/SimonRenblad/chat-bot-group-1" class="button next">GitHub Repo</a></li>
									</ul>
									<h2>Reflection</h2>
									<p>
										I think this project was very useful in teaching me how to use Rasa and to get started thinking about the potential use-cases for chat bots as a form of HCI. 
										It also taught me the incredible value of user testing and user feedback, because in only 7 minutes I was able to catch mistakes I had not seen or things I 
										did not think of that made v1.2 much better. Although we did not use a very formal approach, I believe that our chaotic way made sense given the time pressure. 
										I believe that we should have started working on the project much earlier, and I am going to be very proactive in starting Project 3 right away to get the team 
										thinking about ideas early. 
									</p>
									<p>
										When it comes to the teamwork aspect, I believe that I contributed a lot to the team. My function is the most vertical out of the other functions. I implement form 
										validation and the action server while the other functions do not. I also took on a leadership role, as seen in the screen capture below this paragraph I was often 
										delegating tasks and making decisions. I am happy with my effort, but again I believe we should have started working on it earlier, because we could have used a more 
										formalized approach to development.
									</p>
									<div class="box alt">
										<div class="row gtr-50 gtr-uniform">
											<div class="col-4"><span class="image fit"><img src="images/leadership_teamwork.png" alt="" /></span></div>
										</div>
									</div>
									<p>
										As for the prototype itself, I believe that my function still has a lot of potential for growth. I mentioned this in the presentation as well, but I would like to add 
										functionality for multiple dishes and connect the bot to an external API that handles all the hotels orders. I also want to implement pricing and payment systems. 
										I tried to find APIs for food delivery services such as foodpanda or deliveroo, however I was unable to find anything, so I decided it would be a task for the future. 
										It has definetly given me an idea for future personal projects, because I believe a lot of applications could benefit from a food delivery API. I also would have liked 
										to change the front-end layout more to differentiate it from the tutorial, but unfortunately nobody on the team was familar with React so we focused heavily on Rasa instead. 
									</p>
									<p>
										In conclusion, this project has been very educational both as a developer and taking a leadership role. Although I would have liked to add more detailed features, I am still 
										happy with our prototype. Looking forward to the last project!
